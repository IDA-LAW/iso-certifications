# Risk Assessment Matrix

## Purpose
The Risk Assessment Matrix is a tool used to evaluate and prioritize risks associated with business continuity. It helps organizations identify potential threats and their impact on operations, enabling effective risk management strategies.

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Description               | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Level (L/M/H) | Mitigation Strategy                     |
|--------------------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Example Risk 1                 | 3                | 4            | M                   | Implement additional training           |
| Example Risk 2                 | 2                | 5            | M                   | Develop a contingency plan             |
| Example Risk 3                 | 4                | 3            | M                   | Regularly review and update policies    |
| Example Risk 4                 | 5                | 5            | H                   | Immediate action required               |

## Instructions
1. Identify potential risks to business continuity.
2. Assess the likelihood and impact of each risk on a scale of 1 to 5.
3. Determine the overall risk level (Low, Medium, High) based on the likelihood and impact scores.
4. Develop and implement mitigation strategies for each identified risk.
