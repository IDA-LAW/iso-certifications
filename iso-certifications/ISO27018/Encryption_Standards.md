# Encryption Standards for Data Protection

## Introduction
This document outlines the encryption standards to be followed for data protection in compliance with ISO 27018. It is essential to ensure that all sensitive data is adequately protected against unauthorized access and breaches.

## Encryption Standards

### 1. Data at Rest
- **AES-256**: All sensitive data stored on servers must be encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a key size of 256 bits.
- **Key Management**: Encryption keys must be managed securely, with access restricted to authorized personnel only.

### 2. Data in Transit
- **TLS 1.2 or Higher**: All data transmitted over networks must be encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 or higher.
- **VPN Usage**: Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) should be used for remote access to ensure secure data transmission.

### 3. End-to-End Encryption
- **Application-Level Encryption**: Sensitive data should be encrypted at the application level before being sent to storage or transmitted over networks.
- **User Authentication**: Strong user authentication mechanisms must be in place to ensure that only authorized users can access encrypted data.

### 4. Regular Audits and Compliance
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain audit trails of all encryption key usage and access to encrypted data.
- **Compliance Checks**: Regularly review and update encryption standards to ensure compliance with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

## Conclusion
Adhering to these encryption standards is crucial for protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance with ISO 27018. Regular training and awareness programs should be conducted to ensure that all employees understand the importance of data encryption.
